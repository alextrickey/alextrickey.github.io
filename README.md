## Summary of Qualifications
While completing her PhD in Quantitative Psychology, Alex became an expert in Statistics through her studies, research and teaching. Since joining OnPrem’s Data and Analytics Practice as a Consultant, she has gained experience working with new technologies and with data that is larger and less structured. In future positions, Alex hopes to combine her academic and industry experiences by working with a team to build production quality models and continuing to use data to yield actionable insights.
